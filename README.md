# Overview


This website connects to a firestore database which is a cloud database and on this website, a user can add names of people to a database, they can also view all of the people, update names and delete names.

I developed this software to begin my learning of cloud databases.

# Cloud Database


The cloud database I used is a Firestore database and it has 3 different collections each one containing multiple documents.


# Development Environment



I used VSCode as the coding environment and I used JavaScript to connect to the Firestore database along with some methods that I had to import.
